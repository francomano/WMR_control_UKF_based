KF uses linear system, consider the process as a random process
and correct the prediction of the system by minimizing the
distance from the hyperplane of the measurements (eg maximizing
the gaussian distribution of xk+1 Pk+1).
EKF linearize the system by using just one point as mean of
the Gaussian, i.e.
the previous estimate xk + f(..)
and apply KF.
UKF samples more than one point in an intelligent way (in such a
way we don't need to much points), it maps those points by
using f(..) and then compute again the mean and the covariance
to approximate the trasformed gaussian.
